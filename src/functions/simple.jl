"""
    tensorcopy(A, IA, IC = IA)

Creates a copy of `A`, where the dimensions of `A` are assigned indices from the
iterable `IA` and the indices of the copy are contained in `IC`. Both iterables
should contain the same elements in a different order.

The result of this method is equivalent to `permutedims(A, p)` where p is the permutation
such that `IC = IA[p]`. The implementation of `tensorcopy` is however more efficient on
average, especially if `Threads.nthreads() > 1`.

    tensoradd(A, IA, B, IB, IC = IA)

Returns the result of adding arrays `A` and `B` where the iterabels `IA` and `IB`
denote how the array data should be permuted in order to be added. More specifically,
the result of this method is equivalent to

```julia
tensorcopy(A, IA, IC) + tensorcopy(B, IB, IC)
```

but without creating the temporary permuted arrays.

    tensortrace(A, IA [, IC])

Trace or contract pairs of indices of array `A`, by assigning them an identical
indices in the iterable `IA`. The untraced indices, which are assigned a unique index,
can be reordered according to the optional argument `IC`. The default value corresponds
to the order in which they appear. Note that only pairs of indices can be contracted,
so that every index in `IA` can appear only once (for an untraced index) or twice
(for an index in a contracted pair).

"""
    tensorcontract(A, IA, B, IB[, IC])

Contract indices of array `A` with corresponding indices in array `B` by assigning
them identical labels in the iterables `IA` and `IB`. The indices of the resulting
array correspond to the indices that only appear in either `IA` or `IB` and can be
ordered by specifying the optional argument `IC`. The default is to have all open
indices of array `A` followed by all open indices of array `B`. Note that inner
contractions of an array should be handled first with `tensortrace`, so that every
label can appear only once in `IA` or `IB` seperately, and once (for open
index) or twice (for contracted index) in the union of `IA` and `IB`.

The contraction can be performed by a native Julia algorithm without creating any
temporaries, or by first permuting the arrays such that the contraction becomes equivalent
to a matrix product, which is then performed by BLAS. The latter is typically faster for
large arrays. The choice of method is globally controlled by the methods
[`enable_blas()`](@ref) and [`disable_blas()`](@ref).

"""
    tensorproduct(A, IA, B, IB, IC = (IA..., IB...))

Computes the tensor product of two arrays `A` and `B`, i.e. returns a new array `C`
with `ndims(C) = ndims(A)+ndims(B)`. The indices of the output tensor are related to
those of the input tensors by the pattern specified by the indices. Essentially,
this is a special case of `tensorcontract` with no indices being contracted over.
This method checks whether the indices indeed specify a tensor product instead of
a genuine contraction.
