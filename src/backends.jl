# Backends for tensor operations
#--------------------------------
"""
    abstract type AbstractBackend
    
Abstract supertype for all backends that can be used for tensor operations. In particular,
these control different implementations of executing the basic operations.
"""
abstract type AbstractBackend end

"""
    DefaultBackend()

Default backend for tensor operations if no explicit backend is specified. This will select
an actual implementation backend using the `select_backend(tensorfun, tensors...)` mechanism.
"""
struct DefaultBackend <: AbstractBackend end

"""
    NoBackend()

Backend that will be returned if no suitable backend can be found for the given tensors.
"""
struct NoBackend <: AbstractBackend end

"""
    select_backend([tensorfun::Function], tensors...) -> AbstractBackend

Select the default backend for the given tensors or tensortypes. If `tensorfun` is provided,
it is possible to more finely control the backend selection based on the function as well.
"""
select_backend(tensorfun::Function, tensors...) = select_backend(tensors...)
select_backend(tensors...) = NoBackend()

# Base backends
#-----------------
"""
    BaseCopy()

Backend for tensor operations that should work for all `AbstractArray` types and only uses
functions from the `Base` module, as well as `LinearAlgebra.mul!`.
"""
struct BaseCopy <: AbstractBackend end

"""
    BaseView()

Backend for tensor operations that should work for all `AbstractArray` types and only uses
functions from the `Base` module, as well as `LinearAlgebra.mul!`, and furthermore tries to
avoid any intermediate allocations by using views.
"""
struct BaseView <: AbstractBackend end

# Strided backends
#-----------------
"""
    StridedNative()
    
Backend for tensor operations that is based on `StridedView` objects with native Julia
implementations of tensor operations.
"""
struct StridedNative <: AbstractBackend end

"""
    StridedBLAS()
    
Backend for tensor operations that is based on using `StridedView` objects and rephrasing
the tensor operations as BLAS operations.
"""
struct StridedBLAS <: AbstractBackend end

const StridedBackend = Union{StridedNative, StridedBLAS}

# CuTENSOR backend
#-----------------
"""
    cuTENSORBackend()
Backend for tensor operations that is based on the NVIDIA cuTENSOR library.
"""
struct cuTENSORBackend <: AbstractBackend end
