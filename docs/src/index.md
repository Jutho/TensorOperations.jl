## Package features

*   A macro `@tensor` for conveniently specifying tensor contractions and index permutations
    via Einstein's index notation convention. The index notation is analyzed at compile time.
*   Ability to
    [optimize pairwise contraction order](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.90.033315)
    using the `@tensoropt` macro. This optimization is performed at compile time, and the resulting contraction order is hard coded into the resulting expression. The similar macro `@tensoropt_verbose` provides more information on the optimization process.
*   A function `ncon` (for network contractor) for contracting a group of
    tensors (a.k.a. a tensor network), as well as a corresponding `@ncon` macro that
    simplifies and optimizes this slightly. Unlike the previous macros, `ncon` and `@ncon`
    do not analyze the contractions at compile time, thus allowing them to deal with
    dynamic networks or index specifications.
*   Support for any Julia Base array which qualifies as strided, i.e. such that its entries
    are layed out according to a regular pattern in memory. The only exception are
    `ReinterpretedArray` objects (implementation provided by Strided.jl, see below).
    Additionally, `Diagonal` objects whose underlying diagonal data is stored as a strided
    vector are supported. This facilitates tensor contractions where one of the operands is
    e.g. a diagonal matrix of singular values or eigenvalues, which are returned as a
    `Vector` by Julia's `eigen` or `svd` method.
*   Support for `CuArray` objects if used together with CUDA.jl, by relying
    on (and thus providing a high level interface into) NVidia's
    [cuTENSOR](https://developer.nvidia.com/cutensor) library.
*   Implementation can easily be extended to other types, by overloading a small set of
    methods.
*   Efficient implementation of a number of basic tensor operations (see below), by relying
    on [Strided.jl](https://github.com/Jutho/Strided.jl) and `gemm` from BLAS for
    contractions. The latter is optional but on by default, it can be controlled by a
    package wide setting via `enable_blas()` and `disable_blas()`. If BLAS is disabled or
    cannot be applied (e.g. non-matching or non-standard numerical types), Strided.jl is
    also used for the contraction.
*   A package wide cache for storing temporary arrays that are generated when evaluating
    complex tensor expressions within the `@tensor` macro (based on the implementation of
    [LRUCache](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/LRUCache.jl)). By default, the cache is
    allowed to use up to the minimum of either 1GB or 25% of the total memory.
*   Utility debugging features to dynamically compare contractions orders with their
    optimal counterpart.

## Tensor operations

TensorOperations.jl is centered around 3 basic tensor operations, i.e. primitives in which
every more complicated tensor expression is deconstructed.

1.  **addition:** Add a (possibly scaled version of) one array to another array, where the
    indices of the both arrays might appear in different orders. This operation combines
    normal array addition and index permutation. It includes as a special case copying one
    array into another with permuted indices.

    The actual implementation is provided by [Strided.jl](https://github.com/Jutho/Strided.jl),
    which contains multithreaded implementations and cache-friendly blocking
    strategies for an optimal efficiency.

2.  **trace or inner contraction:** Perform a trace/contraction over pairs of indices of an
    array, where the result is a lower-dimensional array. As before, the actual
    implementation is provided by [Strided.jl](https://github.com/Jutho/Strided.jl).

3.  **contraction:** Performs a general contraction of two tensors, where some indices of
    one array are paired with corresponding indices in a second array. This is typically
    handled by first permuting (a.k.a. transposing) and reshaping the two input arrays such
    that the contraction becomes equivalent to a matrix multiplication, which is then
    performed by the highly efficient `gemm` method from BLAS. The resulting array might
    need another reshape and index permutation to bring it in its final form.
    Alternatively, a native Julia implementation that does not require the additional
    transpositions (yet is typically slower) can be selected by using `disable_blas()`.

## To do list

*   Make it easier to optimize based on memory footprint or other custom cost functions.
